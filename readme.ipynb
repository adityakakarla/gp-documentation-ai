       "## Summary\n",
       "This pipeline is designed to perform spatial enrichment analysis on normalized transcriptomics data using the STenrich algorithm. It provides parameters for controlling various aspects of the analysis, including input file type, gene set database, and parameters for estimating null distributions.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Use Cases\n",
       "The following use cases demonstrate the application of this pipeline:\n",
       "\n",
       "* Performing spatial enrichment analysis on a sample of 1000 high expression ROIs/spots/cells across multiple conditions.\n",
       "* Testing a gene set in different samples with varying minimum spot/ROI/cell numbers to ensure robustness.\n",
       "* Calculating standard deviations to define the high-expression threshold for a specific gene set.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Implementation\n",
       "This pipeline consists of the following modules:\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Input Preprocessing**: normalizes spatial transcriptomics data coming from the `spatialGE.Preprocessing` module.\n",
       "* **Gene Set Database Selection**: selects a gene set database to test for spatial enrichment (upload if not listed in MSigDB).\n",
       "* **Permutation Estimation**: estimates null distributions using different permutations of the STenrich algorithm.\n",
       "* **Random Seed Replication**: replicates results with varying random seed values to check for consistency.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Parameters\n",
       "The following parameters control various aspects of the analysis:\n",
       "\n",

       "| `minimum_genes` | The minimum number of genes of a set required to be present in a sample, for that gene set to be tested in that sample | 5 | Yes |\n",
       "| `standard_deviations` | The number of standard deviations to define the high-expression threshold | 1.0 | No |\n",
       "| `filter_p_values` | Plot only gene sets whose multiple test adjusted p-value is less than this threshold | 0.05 | No |\n",
       "| `filter_gene_proportion` | Plot only gene sets where the proportional number genes in the set present in the field of view equals or exceeds this threshold | 0.3 | No |\n",
